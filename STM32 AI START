## Files of interest
- `Core/Src/main.c` — main loop and ai init/run.
- `X-CUBE-AI/App/` — Cube.AI runtime + generated model files.
- `img.h` — embedded test image (INT8).
- `network_*.c / .h` — generated model API (names may vary).

## How the model is run (summary)
1. Model created and quantized to INT8 (TFLite).
2. Converted by STM32Cube.AI → C code and weights.
3. In `main.c`: model is initialized (ai_network_*_init) and activations allocated.
4. Input buffer is filled from `img.h`.
5. `ai_network_run()` is called and outputs are searched for the maximum class.

## Add your own image
1. Preprocess image to same size and quantization used for training (grayscale → 32×32 or 96×96 depending on model).
2. Convert to signed INT8 values (range -128..127) and replace array in `img.h`.
3. Rebuild and flash.

## Demo / serial output
The firmware prints prediction index and score to UART (115200 baud). Map index to label names in `main.c` (or create a `labels[]` array).
